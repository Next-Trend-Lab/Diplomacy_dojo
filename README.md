+
+**Empowering effective communication and negotiation through advanced AI.**
+
+The AI Diplomacy Toolkit is a sophisticated platform designed to simulate complex negotiation scenarios and facilitate constructive dialogue. Leveraging the power of Google Cloud's Vertex AI (specifically Gemini models), Speech-to-Text, and Text-to-Speech services, this toolkit provides users with an interactive environment to practice, analyze, and enhance their diplomatic and communication skills.

+
+## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
+
+The AI Diplomacy Toolkit operates with a decoupled frontend and backend architecture:
+
+1.  **Frontend (Streamlit):**
+    *   Provides the user interface for initiating negotiations, taking turns, facilitating dialogues, and viewing results.
+    *   Captures user input (text or audio) and sends requests to the FastAPI backend.
+    *   Displays responses and analysis received from the backend.
+
+2.  **Backend (FastAPI):**
+    *   **API Endpoints:** Exposes various RESTful endpoints for negotiation and dialogue facilitation.
+    *   **`NegotiationService`:** Orchestrates the core logic for negotiation simulations and dialogue analysis. It manages session state, interacts with AI agents, and processes user turns.
+    *   **`LLMAgent`:** Interfaces with Google Cloud Vertex AI to leverage Gemini models for generating AI responses, analyzing text, and providing feedback.
+    *   **`AudioService`:**
+        *   **Speech-to-Text:** Transcribes user's spoken input (if provided as audio) into text using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
+        *   **Text-to-Speech:** Converts AI-generated text responses into audible speech (MP3 format) using Google Cloud Text-to-Speech.
+    *   **Data Flow for a Negotiation Turn (with audio):**
+        *   User speaks into the microphone (captured by Streamlit frontend).
+        *   Frontend base64 encodes the audio and sends it to the `/negotiate/turn` endpoint.
+        *   FastAPI receives the request.
+        *   `AudioService` transcribes the audio to text.
+        *   `NegotiationService` processes the transcribed text, interacts with `LLMAgent` for AI responses.
+        *   `LLMAgent` (via Gemini) generates text responses for AI agents.
+        *   `AudioService` converts AI text responses to base64 encoded audio.
+        *   FastAPI returns text and audio responses to the Streamlit frontend.
+        *   Frontend displays text and allows playback of audio.
+
+3.  **Google Cloud Platform:**
+    *   **Vertex AI (Gemini):** Provides the core intelligence for AI agents' responses, dialogue analysis, and feedback generation.
+    *   **Cloud Speech-to-Text API:** Converts spoken audio into written text.
+    *   **Cloud Text-to-Speech API:** Synthesizes text into natural-sounding speech.

+
+## üöÄ Getting Started
+
+Follow these instructions to set up and run the AI Diplomacy Toolkit locally.
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+*   **Python:** Version 3.10 or higher.
+*   **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI):** Installed and configured. Installation Guide.
+*   **Google Cloud Project:**
+    *   A Google Cloud Project with billing enabled.
+    *   The following APIs enabled in your project:
+        *   Vertex AI API
+        *   Cloud Speech-to-Text API
+        *   Cloud Text-to-Speech API
+*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
+
+### Setup Instructions
+
+1.  **Clone the Repository:**
+    ```bash
+    git clone <your-repository-url>
+    cd ai_diplomacy_toolkit
+    ```
+
+2.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**
+    ```bash
+    python -m venv venv
+    # On Windows
+    .\venv\Scripts\activate
+    # On macOS/Linux
+    source venv/bin/activate
+    ```
+
+3.  **Install Dependencies:**
+    *(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file. If not, create one based on project imports.)*
+    ```bash
+    pip install -r requirements.txt
+    ```
+    *Likely dependencies for `requirements.txt` (create this file if it doesn't exist):*
+    ```
+    fastapi
+    uvicorn[standard]
+    pydantic
+    python-dotenv
+    google-cloud-aiplatform
+    google-cloud-speech
+    google-cloud-texttospeech
+    streamlit
+    requests
+    ```
+
+4.  **Configure Google Cloud:**
+    *   **Set Project ID:** Create a `.env` file in the project root (`ai_diplomacy_toolkit/.env`) and add your Google Cloud Project ID:
+        ```env
+        GCP_PROJECT_ID="your-actual-gcp-project-id-here"
+        ```
+        Replace `"your-actual-gcp-project-id-here"` with your actual Project ID.
+    *   **Authenticate with Google Cloud:** Run the following command in your terminal and follow the prompts to log in with your Google account that has access to the configured project and APIs:
+        ```bash
+        gcloud auth application-default login
+        ```
+        This sets up Application Default Credentials (ADC) which the Google Cloud client libraries will use.
+
+### Running the Application
+
+You'll need to run the backend and frontend in two separate terminal windows (with the virtual environment activated in both).
+
+1.  **Start the FastAPI Backend:**
+    In your first terminal, navigate to the project root and run:
+    ```bash
+    uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
+    ```
+    You should see output indicating Uvicorn is running on `http://0.0.0.0:8000`.
+
+2.  **Start the Streamlit Frontend:**
+    In your second terminal, navigate to the project root and run:
+    ```bash
+    streamlit run streamlit_app.py
+    ```
+    Streamlit will typically open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).
+

+
+## üîó API Endpoints
+
+The FastAPI backend provides several endpoints. For detailed information, interactive testing, and request/response schemas, visit the auto-generated API documentation once the backend is running:
